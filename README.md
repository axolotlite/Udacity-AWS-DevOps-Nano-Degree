This is my repo containing exercises, scripts and challanges from the Advanced Cloud DevOps Nanodegree, I am planing on using bash scripting to streamline the tasks written both as a way to gain more practical understanding of what is being asked of me and to further my bash experience. 
The repo will be seperated into branches, each containing its respective material until I finish the course then I shall merge all of the material into main in a neat and orderly fashion.
